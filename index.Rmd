## Perfil profesional

I am a digital nomad and entrepreneur. I am a political scientist from UC. I have extensive experience in data processing, data analysis and information reporting. I'm curious, so I'm interested in the changes that are taking place in the digital era, both in human relations and in new forms of productivity. I'm an innate scrum master. I stand out for being adaptable, open to challenges and an integral professional.

I'm interested in being in challenging work spaces that seek to innovate.

I'm in constant training, since the world is moving very fast and my goal is to use technology for our benefit.
